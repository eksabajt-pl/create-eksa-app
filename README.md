## Why?

Well, we've figured that when you're developing an app, most of the time you'd be repeating the same code and commands over and over... So why bother, why spend 5 minutes initializing a project while you could spend x months to make a tool that does exactly that.

So we are trying to make a tool that would be useful for us and would give us at least half an hour more time when setting up a new project. This tool would simply create a project ready with tailwindcss, shadcn/ui, next-theme, drizzle, auth.js, next-intl and more... so we can focus on quickly shipping our app.

## Initializing a project

```bash
npm create eksa-app@latest
```

## Getting Started

Change directory into your app and then run the development server:

```bash
cd my-eksabajt-app
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
